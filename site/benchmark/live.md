# Live-agent evaluation

::: tip The short version
In live runs with a real model, Parley costs about the same as a REST-style MCP server: 3–15% more per task, with the same success rate. It adds a policy the service enforces, previews before anything changes, and undo. Neither arm broke the user's rules, even under prompt injection; with Parley, that doesn't depend on the model behaving.
